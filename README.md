# Example Rush Monorepo

This template is part of the documentation of the [Rush](https://rushjs.io/) tool. It contains documented templates for all the standard Rush configuration files. It also includes three barebones projects that illustrate some dependency relationships in a Rush repo:

- **apps/my-app**: The web application
- **libraries/my-controls**: A control library used by the application
- **tools/my-toolchain**: A NodeJS build tool used to compile the other projects

(These projects are NOT meant to provide a realistic toolchain.)

# Building this repo

To build the projects in this repo, try these shell commands:

```
npm install -g @microsoft/rush
rush install
rush build
```

For more information, see the documentation at: https://rushjs.io/

# How It Works

To truly understand a mono repo, you need to understand how a single application is built, watched, served, and seen by your code editor. Each of these steps are interdependent and defined inside a myriad of config files.

## Steps In The Process

### Building A FE app

1. Bundle Dependent Code -> package.json/tsconfig.json

- description
  - Our app has dependencies. We need to get these dependencies on our computer for it to run.
  - Our dependencies have dependencies. These need to be flattened/optimized/deduped
- configs
  - package.json
  - tsconfig.json
- runners/packages
  - npm
  - pnpm
  - yarn
- commands
  - npm install

2. Configure Code Locations -> package.json/tsconfig.json

- description
  - Our Editor, Compiler, and Builder need to know where to look to find the code
- configs
  - package.json
  - tsconfig.json
- commands/runners that use this
  - tsc
  - rollup
  - webpack
  - vite
  - vscode
  - esbuild

2. Lint Your Code -> eslint/tslint

- description
  - defines how our code looks in the editor
  - defines what code we are allowed to write
- configs
  - eslint.config.js -> what is allowed
  - prettier.config.js -> how it looks
  - tsconfig.json -> what is allowed
  - tailwind.config.js -> additional autocompletion options
- commands/runners
  - npm run lint

3. Test Your Code -> jest/cypress/enzyme

- description
  - we need to emulate an environment that runs our code in order to check if it actually works
  - we need to tell the editor/test runner what files define the tests(i.e. .spec, .test, etc.)
  - we need to tell the bundler to not compile these files at build time, since our consumers don't give a fuck about them.
  - we need to configure how the test runner acts(concurrency, startup/pre run scripts, etc.)
  - jest, cypress, enzyme, mocha, chai, etc. are all "test runners" that can be individually configured and run
  - We often use coverage reports and/or push this coverage to certain technologies that check our coverage
- configs
  - jest.config.js || package.json
  - (rollup|webpack|vite).config.js
- commands/runners
  - jest
  - cypress
  - codcov, coverall, nyc

4. Build Final Dependencies -> npm/pnpm/yarn

- description
  - dev dependencies
    - Our project is being built for a consumer. That could be a library, a server, or a JS application.
    - This consumer does not give a fuck about our development environment
    - All packages/techologies that we have to make our dev environment nicer need to be removed
  - peer dependencies
    - our project doesn't use lodash, but it uses material-ui. material-ui uses lodash. To build the correct MUI code, we need to also have lodash's code.
  - duplicate dependencies
    - duplicate dependencies come from peer dependencies.
    - our project might have lodash. it might also have material-ui, which uses lodash as well.
    - we don't want a bunch of duplicate code in production, so we want to remove these where we can.
    - Semvar claims that a library will not contain any breaking changes unless the first number changes.
      - In a perfect world, we can use the same version of a library as long as the first number isn't different.
      - the world is not perfect.
      - npm/yarn/pnpm all suck dick and frequently fuck your world up as a result of this.
  - unused dependencies
    - our app might have lodash, and not use it anywhere.
    - this dependency will be built anyway, because this step does not do anything but see what's in your package.json and then build it.
- configs
  - package.json
- commands/runners
  - npm/pnpm/yarn

5. Compile Javascript Code So that Our Consumer Can Understand It -> tsc/babel

- description
  - many systems don't know how to compile typescript, we we have to change it to node
  - many systems don't know how to compile newer versions of node, so we have to change it to an older version
  - Babel is a compiler that does this, the tsc compiler can also accomplish this.
  - Babel has a larger ecosystem of plugins that allow you more fine grained control over this part of the process configs
  - We also want to do this for all the dependencies we've added.
- configs
  - tsconfig.json
  - babel.config.js -> transform to older version of node commands/runners
- commands/runners
  - tsc build --flags
  - npx babel --flgs
  - rollup --flags

6. Compile React Code so that Our Consumer can understand it -> rollup/webpack/babel

- description
  - browsers don't give a fuck about react. it's a toolchain used to make development easier.
  - we need to transform react code into pure JS code
- configs
  - babel.config.js
  - rollup.config.js
- runners
  - rollup
  - babel

7. Tree Shake Application: Remove Unused Javascript Code -> rollup/webpack

- description
  - Sometimes we write a function/make a file and then we don't delete it.
  - Sometimes we import a library with 600 functions, but only use 3 of them.
  - Tree Shaking removes unused code
- configs
  - rollup.config.js
- runners
  - rollup/webpack/vite

8. Minify Javascript Code -> uglifyJS/terser

- description
  - We want our bundle as small as possible
  - characters take up space
  - our compiler doesn't give a fuck about spaces or newline characters
  - to make things more efficient, we deleted all spaces/new lines when it makes sense.
- configs
  - uglifyJS/terser
- runners/commands

7. Compile CSS files so that our javascript/the browser can understand it -> postcss/node-sass/autoprefixer/tailwind

- descriptions
  - sass/scss isn't supported by default. we need to compile this so that it can be understood
  - we also need to put all our separate css files into one big css file
  - sometimes browsers want different versions of css classes, we want to add those extra versions automatically.
  - we also want our editor to understand any css libraries(i.e. tailwind)
- configs?
  - postcss.config.js

8. Remove CSS classes that we don't use -> purgecss

- description
  - sometimes we make 200 classes and only use 3
  - tailwind gives like 10000 classes, we'll never use all of them
  - we don't want to serve all that shit, so we remove the classes that aren't used.
- configs
  - purceCSS
  - tailwind.config.js
- runners
  - purgeCss is often used in rollup/webpack/vite
